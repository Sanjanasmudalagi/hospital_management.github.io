🛠 Projects

Hospital Management System

OVERVIEW:
The Hospital Management System is designed to address key challenges in the healthcare industry, including patient data management, appointment scheduling, billing, and resource allocation. By implementing a centralized digital platform, it streamlines operations, enhances patient care, and ensures efficient communication across departments. This solution aims to create a seamless, efficient, and patient-centered healthcare environment.

Technical Stack:

Languages: C++, Python

Algorithms: Priority Queues, Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS), Scheduling Algorithms

Tools: Database Management Systems (DBMS), Web Development Frameworks, Healthcare APIs


Impact:

1. Improved Patient Care:

Facilitates quick access to patient records, enhancing diagnosis and treatment.



2. Operational Efficiency:

Streamlines administrative processes such as billing, scheduling, and resource allocation.



3. Data Security:
